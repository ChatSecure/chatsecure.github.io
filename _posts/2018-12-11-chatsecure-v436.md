# ChatSecure v4.3.6

This maintenance release contains an important update to the certificate pinning alert dialog. After updating to v4.3.6 you may see an alert asking you to re-verify your server's SSL/TLS certificate.

Previously, the dialog would display `âœ… Valid` if the certificate was valid for *any* domain. Additionally, it was then pinning the certificate to the connected domain (e.g. `xmpp.example.com` from the SRV records), and not to the JID domain (e.g. `example.com`).

If you are not automatically prompted to re-verify, you should manually re-verify your server's certificates by going into Settings -> Pinned Certificates, delete the existing entries, and then reconnect.

Special thanks to Michel Le Bihan, for uncovering the flaw and quickly proposing a fix.
